# Contributing to Us

Welcome to Doocs! This document is a guideline about how to contribute to qcloud-im-server-sdk-java.
If you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments / suggestions.

## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Setting up your development environment

You should have JDK 1.8 or later installed in your system.

## Contributing

We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for typo fix, bug fix or big new features.
Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.

We strongly value documentation and integration with other projects.
We are very glad to accept improvements for these aspects.

### GitHub workflow

We use the `dev` branch as the development branch, which indicates that this is a unstable branch.

Here are the workflow for contributors:

1. Fork to your own
2. Clone fork to local repository
3. Create a new branch and work on it
4. Keep your branch in sync
5. Commit your changes (make sure your commit message concise)
6. Push your commits to your forked repository
7. Create a pull request

After creating a PR, one or more reviewers will be assigned to the pull request.
The reviewers will review the code.

Before merging a PR, squash any fix review feedback, typo, merged, and rebased sorts of commits.
The final commit message should be clear and concise.
